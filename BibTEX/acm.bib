abstract = {Social Media applications have become one of the most pervasive and most used digital technologies in modern societies. Consumer uses it, among others, to share and consume information, stay in contact with other users and to stay up to date about local events and activities. As producer, it serves as a highly targeted advertising platform. However, it can be argued that the main focus of current Social Media platforms is in the promotion of premium content and not, as it is often perceived, the promotion of inter-human relationships. The former concept relies on engagement trackings, such as likes and comments, to assess interest for content targeting. Interhuman relationships, however, are more difficult to assess, measure and therefore promote. This is mostly due to the complexity of trust-based interactions between individuals. Without assessing trustworthiness however it is difficult to promote meaningful relationships in Social Media Applications. To overcome this shortcoming we introduce a model of interpersonal trust as a function of multidimensional features that applies to Social Media specific interactions.},

abstract = {What should manager's do to boost their ability of pursuing exploration and exploitation? Extant researches has pointed out a series of antecedents of manager's exploration and exploitation, the literature has yet to realize the importance of interpersonal trust. While most researches encourage managers to be a central figure in their trust relationship with employees which refers to have trust relations with employees as much as they can, our study suggests that they should be a key figure, which is, a broker. Drawing from social network theory, we develop and test a theoretical model that explains how manager's trust brokerage facilitates manager's exploration and exploitation. By using a sample of 101 managers, we find that managers who bridge trust between two who distrust each other is more exploratory and exploitative. Overall, this paper provides theoretical and practical implications on how interpersonal trust affect manager's exploration and exploitation. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

abstract = {Main focus of this paper is placed on team creativity. In order for an organization to remain competitive, team creativity level should be controlled to stay higher than an average level that rival companies are believed to show. Beyond managers' control, we emphasize a voluntarily and informally emergent structure and introduce a social network perspective within team creativity. Since a team is composed of individual members, and a certain kind of leadership and trust exist in the team to affect team creativity, it is necessary to investigate relationships between leadership, trust and team creativity in a rigorous way. In this sense, we propose a team creativity model in which shared leadership, interpersonal trust (affect-based trust and cognition-based trust), and knowledge-sharing are included and their subsequent influence on team creativity is analyzed. For the sake of empirical analysis, an e-learning course was administered in a private university, and 40 teams were organized for this study. 249 valid questionnaires were garnered, and analyzed by structural equation model. Results show that shared leadership, knowledge sharing and cognition-based trust significantly influence team creativity.},

abstract = {Social media platforms provide access to informational and emotional resources that can enable low-income populations to further their socioeconomic mobility and cope with unexpected life demands. However, lack of both interpersonal trust and a sense of shared identity often prevent low-income individuals from eliciting resources from the diverse networks embedded in these platforms. Building on past research, we investigated factors that facilitated and deterred low-income members of the community-based non-profit organization Family Independence Initiative (FII) from seeking informational and emotional support from other members on the organization's social media platform, UpTogether. We found that despite participants' perceived shared identity, members primarily requested resources from other UpTogether members through offline interactions due to lack of interpersonal trust. We extend existing research on the limitations of shared identity and the role of interpersonal trust and social norms in facilitating resource-seeking interactions among strangers in low-income contexts. We suggest that social media platforms incorporate pseudonymous posting to facilitate relationship development and allow users to disclose their needs without revealing identifying information.},

abstract = {This paper reports a detailed empirical study of interpersonal trust in a multi-relational online social network. This study addresses two main aspects of interpersonal trust: formation and reciprocation. Computational models developed, using multi-relational networks, for these processes provide interesting insights about online social interactions. Our findings for trust formation (initiation) indicate a strong role of lower familiarity interactions before trust(high familiarity relationship) is formed. Similarly, trust reciprocation is not automatic, but strongly depends on enough lower familiarity interactions. This study is the first quantification of the “scaffolding role” played by lower familiarity interactions, in formation of high familiarity relationships.},

abstract = {Employers are more concerned than ever with effective hiring. Business competes for personnel in a dynamic employment market; securing the best prospective employee requires dedicated use of parallel networking channels to identify applicants of interest. One channel is interpersonal and is highly favored, carrying the power of interpersonal trust in the form of recommendations from "known others." Applicants and employers, alike, favor strong personal connections when it comes to evaluating opportunities and prospects. The other channel is intermediated, and characterizes the confused conventional knowledge notion that online social media are effective channels through which applicants can influence employers. The true state of this channel's effect lies more in the employer's ability to use online social media as a filtering and qualifying mechanism to vet employees in advance of considering whether to engage in further interactions toward employment.},

abstract = {This paper investigates trust in news on a social media platform. The paper is motivated by the finding that social media is the primary news source for a large group of people, especially young adults. Considering the challenges posed by online misinformation and fake news, an understanding of how users quantify trust in news and what factors influence this trust is needed. In a study with 108 participants, German high-school students provided trust ratings for online news including quality media and fake news. The study shows that users can quantify their trust in news items and that these trust ratings correspond to rankings of the sources by experts. The paper finds that psychometric scales that measure interpersonal trust are predictive of a user's mean trust rating across different news items. We show how this can be used to provide interventions for those prone to false trust and false distrust.},

abstract = {During organizational entry, newcomers often experience a sense of vulnerability and uncertainty as they seek to learn the knowledge and their roles in the organization, while interpersonal trust is seen to reduce individuals' uncertainty, thus contribute to successful socialization. This study highlights the role of interpersonal trust, both as strengthener of role acquisition willingness, as well as the deepener of social exchange. Drawing from the integration perspective of social embeddedness and role theory, this study examined how newcomers' distinct positions within interpersonal trust network related to their work role performance, identified two important pathways that newcomers may take to assimilate into the organization: (1) become a central figure, thus accomplish transformation into an insider; (2) play the role as a broker which benefit from information channels, thus facilitated work role performance. This study extend previous understanding of organizational entry and socialization not only by clarifying the distinct roles of intense relationships with peers and leaders in achieving performance, but also by bridging understandings of organizational entry that have been derived separately from role-oriented and relational perspectives.},
